#Swap using a temp variable
def swap(a, b):
    temp = a
    a = b
    b = temp

x = 1
y = 2

swap(x, y)
print(x, y)
#Output is 1 2 since the swap function doesn't actually swap the values of a and b in the main program.
# swap(x, y), the values of x and y are passed by value to the function
#Inside the function, the values are swapped and stored in the local variables a and b. 
#However, these variables are not accessible outside of the function.
#Therefore, alues of x and y remain unchanged in the main program and the output is 1 2.
