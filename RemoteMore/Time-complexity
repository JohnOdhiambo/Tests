#The time complexity  is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array arr.
#The outer loop iterates over each element in the array once, which takes O(n) time.
#The inner loop iterates over the remaining elements in the array
#for each element in the outer loop, which takes O(n-1) + O(n-2) + ... + O(1) time, which is equivalent to O(n^2).
#Therefore, the overall time complexity of the function is O(n^2).
