//It initializing two pointers left and right to the start and end of the array respectively
//Repeatedly swaps the elements at those positions until the pointers meet in the middle.
//Time complexity of the process function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array arr.
//The function iterates over half of the array, swapping elements at each iteration. 
//Therefore, the no. of operations performed by the function is proportional to n/2, which simplifies to O(n).
